HPXML Implementation Guide
##########################

The HPXML Data Dictionary and the HPXML Transfer Standard are open data standards published by the Building Performance Institute to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data on residential building and energy performance. 

To expediate market adoption of HPXML, Home Performance with ENERGY STAR(R) developed the HPXML Implementation Guide to help program administrators, implementaters, and software developers integrate HPXML into their operations and products. The Guide is divided into several sections. 

    * Introduction to HPXML - This section provides an overview of HPXML, including its value to the market, and how it is managed. It also has information on how to use this guide.
    * HPXML Standard Datasets - This section has information on HPXML use cases, with links to standard datasets and example HPXML files.
    * Program Administrator Guide - This section is tailored to program administrators, with detailed information on how programs can integrate HPXML into their operations.
    * Software Developer Guide - This section is tailored to software developers that want to integrate HPXML into their products. It contains links to the HPXML schema and has information on how to validate HPXML files. 
    
The Implementation Guide will be updated as new versions of HPXML are released. For more information on HPXML, visit www.hpxmlonline.com.
