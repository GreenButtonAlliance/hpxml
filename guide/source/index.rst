HPXML Implementation Guide
##########################

The HPXML Data Dictionary and the HPXML Transfer Standard are open data standards published by the Building Performance Institute to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data on residential building and energy performance. HPXML enables stakeholder access to the same, well understood terms and data structures that are used for data retrieval, which reduces program administrative and implementation costs, faciltates high-quality research, and reduces costs associated with data cleaning and management for program evaluators. 

To expediate market adoption of HPXML, Home Performance with ENERGY STAR(R) developed the HPXML Implementation Guide to help program administrators, implementaters, and software developers integrate HPXML into existing or new operations and products. The Guide is divided into several sections. 

    * Section 1, Introduction to HPXML. This section provides an overview of HPXML, including its value to the market, and how it is managed. It also has information on how to use this guide.
    * Section 2, HPXML Standard Datasets. This section has information on HPXML use cases, with links to standard datasets and example HPXML files.
    * Section 3, Program Administrator Guide. This section is tailored to program administrators, with detailed information on how programs can integrate HPXML into new or existing operations.
    * Section 4, Software Developer Guide. This section is tailored to software developers that want to integrate HPXML into their products.
    
The Implementation Guide will be updated as new versions of HPXML are released. For more information on HPXML, visit www.hpxmlonline.com.
