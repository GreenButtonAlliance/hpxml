HPXML Implementation Guide
##########################

The Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Team developed the HPXML Implementation
Guide to help program administrators and software developers integrate HPXML
into their operations and products.

HPXML is a set of common definitions, based on Building Performance Institute's
BPI-2100 and BPI-2200 data standards, for the attributes of the systems in a
home and the computing language that facilitates the quick and easy transfer of
home-related data between different market actors.

Today there is a fragmented, siloed marketplace where exchange of data occurs
but with the non-uniform definitions for metrics and lack of two-way feedback
systems. With the use of HPXML, we will see the easy exchange of data between
and among different market actors.
