Step 4: Procuring or Modifying Program Management Systems
#########################################################

Procurement of a HPXML-compliant program management system or modification of
your existing system to be HPXML compliant is a critical juncture for every
HPXML implementation. The cost and scope of this endeavor will be largely
dictated by the business objective(s) that you establish in :ref:`step1` and how you
want to use the data that you defined in :ref:`step3`. The following section will
provide some best practice guidance for acquiring HPXML-compliant program
management software and how to use the tools provided in this guide to assist
in that process.

Build a Clear Scope

    KEVIN, IS THIS SECTION IN LINE WITH WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED IN A QMS? IF NOT, ADD OTHER QUESTIONS/ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE SOW

Clearly outlining your business objectives and defining the dataset you want to
use are two large steps toward building an accurate scope of work to inform you
procurement process.  Within your business objectives, it will be important to
define how you want the data to work for your program. Here are some examples
of items to discuss:

* Are you using the system to qualify projects for incentive or financing?
* What kind of quality assurance do you want to do?

  * How much QA automation do you want to include in the system?
  * What data does your implementation team need to review on the project and at what stages?

* What is the workflow of your program?
* What feedback systems do you want for both contractors and participating customers?
* What type of program reporting are you doing?
* Are you exporting data to third parties? If so, what are the specifications of their systems?

If your program needs to issue an Request for Proposals, there are some additional best practices to consider: 

* Make sure to include all of your program's incentive or financing rules.  This will help the developers understand what pieces of information are most important to you and what you will be reviewing.
* Consider including narrative examples of what you are trying to accomplish this the systems functionality.  Technical specifications are important, but adding commantary on how you want to use it is equally helpful. 
* Ask other programs to share their RFP scopes of work.  With each new program adoption of HPXML, RFPs are getting more consistent and comprehensive. BPI WG-5 can help your procurement team identify recent RFPs and connect you with a program contact. 

Leverage HPXML Experience
*************************

In procuring from a software provider, make sure to consider their HPXML
experience â€” including prior implementations of HPXML and participation in the
BPI W-5.

There are also several program administrators that participate in BPI WG-5. If
you have questions or would like to share their experiences, please reach out by
contacting the group at hpxml@homeperformance.org.

Plan for Testing and HPXML Coordination Support
***********************************************

In your scope and timeline, make sure to leave time for testing and provide
resources for technical support in setup and integration. The amount of
coordination and testing will vary depending on your data selection and use
cases. See the testing section below for further guidance.
