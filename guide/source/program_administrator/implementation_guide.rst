Implementation Guide
####################

A well-designed implementation plan is necessary to sucessfully integrate HPXML into program operations. The following sections will walk you through the process of implementing HPXML and provide guidance that
can serve as a starting point for an implementation plan in your jurisdiction.

Each jurisdiction will have different goals, market needs, and regulatory
requirements that will influence the scope of the HPXML projects. However,
leveraging the experiences of programs who have already implemented HPXML
can lower individual implementation costs and will help drive alignment
between jurisdictions. 

The following "Steps to HPXML Implementation" are
designed to help you efficiently implement HPXML.
