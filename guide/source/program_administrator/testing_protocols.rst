Step 6: Implementing Testing Protocols and User Training
########################################################

With every new HPXML program launch, there are a number of testing activities
that need to happen to maximize the opportunity for success. You should plan for
at least a couple of months of testing. Work with the software community to
schedule each stage of testing. Try to schedule time for your staff to focus on
this activity. If you can set a clear plan for testing early on, and stick to
your production schedule, this should allow you to get to market in a timely and
organized manner.

There are four main testing roles, each of which requires a different group of
testers:

HPXML File Testing
****************** 

This is best completed between your program software provider and third-party
software vendors that are exporting to your system. Ideally, your program
software provider will supply third-party software vendors with a testing
environment in which they can submit test files and receive direct validation
error feedback. Activity will likely be between the IT experts from both your
program software provider and the third-party software vendors.

Program Compliance Testing
**************************

Based on the validation protocols that you have set up, and in order to check
program compliance, a group of testers that are intimately familiar with the
program requirements will review files in a test environment. The goal is to see
if files submitted by the third-party software vendor are being captured in your
program management system and that the system is parsing the data out as
expected. Usually, this is completed by someone from the implementation or QA
team.

End-to-End Testing
******************

Especially if you are using third-party modeling tools, it is important for
testers from the program implementation team to run a series of test homes using
each of the software systems as if they were a participating contractor. This is
to check to see if data entered into each system is making it all the way to
your program database as designed. In addition, you will be familiarizing
yourself with the user experience and can identify potential problems before
releasing to the contractor base. 

User Testing
************

Once you have completed end-to-end testing, it is always good to identify a
group of users (contractors or trade allies) who can try the system in a test
environment or as a soft program launch. Using a limited number of contractors,
you can identify any potential problems before full-scale release.

It is good to designate a program representative responsible for overseeing the
testing process. This person should be equipped to make decisions regarding
software requirements and functionality on behalf of the program. As things are
discovered during the testing process, it will be important to determine what
may need to be fixed before launch verses what can be addressed over time. This
role will help ensure that the program requirements are being met, while keeping
the project on track.  

Home Energy Score Testing
*************************

The Department of Energy has developed a Home Energy Score integration testing
protocol.  For programs participating in Home Energy Score, the DOE will provide
a series of sample homes to facilitate software testing.  Your program
implementation team will need to submit these sample homes as if they were a
contractor or auditor in the field, much like the end-to-end testing process
identified above. Then using the DOE's Home Energy Score API, submit the homes
to the Home Energy Score system. Following the protocols, your program
implementation team will be able to identify validation errors or unexpected
outcomes in the data transfer process.

User Training and Contractor Role Out
*************************************

After testing is complete, you can launch your new HPXML based systems.  As in
most implementation steps up to this point, it is extremely important to engage
your contractor and trade ally networks to achieve success. When rolling out a
new software environment, especially if multiple software products are being
introduced into the market at the same time, programs should coordinate software
training along with the software vendors.  Each software vendor may have their
own training practices, webinars, or other resources they prefer to use. 

The trainings should include a clear understanding of how to
download and upload HPXML files.  This includes making transparent to all users
the data collection requirements that you have determined as a part of your
HPXML implementation.   If contractors are unclear on what to collect and how
the data validation system works, this can create a lot of frustration if
contractor files are rejected by your data validation system. Being very
transparent about this in training can significantly reduce the tech support
requirement for your program implementation team and software vendors, while
also increasing contractor satisfaction. 

.. note::

    If you are implementing Home Energy Score for the first time, all
    participating contractors and auditors must complete a mandatory Home Energy
    Score training.  If you are rolling out HPXML and Home Energy Score
    together, you will want to provide ample opportunity for contractors to
    participate in training and complete all requirements before launch.
