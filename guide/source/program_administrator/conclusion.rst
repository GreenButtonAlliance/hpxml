This concludes the Program Administrator section of the Implementation Guide. The next section provides similar guidance for software developers.

This Implementation Guide is a living document, and will be updated as new versions of HPXML are released to the market. This Implementation Guide will also benefit from the lessons learned
by different organizations integrating HPXML into their operations. If you have
questions about HPXML or believe you can contribute to the overall success of
its deployment, please email us at hpxml@homeperformance.org.
