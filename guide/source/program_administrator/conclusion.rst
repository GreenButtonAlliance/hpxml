Conclusion
##########

This concludes the Program Administrator section of the Implementation Guide. 
The next section will provide similar guidance for software developers.

This Implementation Guide is a living document, but updated as HPXML and the
market evolves. This Implementation Guide will benefit from the lessons learned
by different organizations integrating HPXML into their operations.  If you have
questions about HPXML or believe you can contribute to the overall success of
its deployment, please email us at homeperformance@energystar.gov.

Likewise, if you would like to become more involved in the BPI-WG 5 and help
guide the future of HPXML, email hpxml@homeperformance.org, to be added to the
distribution list and meeting notices.
