Step 1: Setting Implementation Goals
####################################

HPXML can drive a lot of value into a program. The key to delivering this
value is to determine the goals and scope of the HPXML project as early in
the process as possible. To date, many programs have used HPXML as a means to
open the modeling software market in their jurisdiction to multiple vendors. Others have used HPXML to automate their workscopes through the validation of standardized data. Regardless of your plans, it is important to clearly define your objectives early because these decisions will shape your implementation tactics.

To start, review each of the bullet points in the :doc:`opportunities_benefits` section.
Highlight which opportunities you would like to take advantage of in your
program implementation. For each opportunity, identify the following
information:

* **What is the baseline now and where do you want to be?** For example, if you
  want to "reduce the data collection burden for program participants," you
  will need to know how much it currently costs contractors in time or money to
  participate in the program. Then you may work with them to identify a goal.
  
* **What are some of your program's current pain points?**  For example, are there specific
  elements of your current program implementation that drive customer or
  contractor dissatisfaction? Likewise, are there any procedures in your
  process that create opportunities for error or mistakes? 
  
* **How will this help achieve overall program goals?** For example,
  what is the current number of projects per year and what is the target number of projects you would like to complete? If you are focused on volume, you may want to automatically generate Home Energy Score or the Certificate of Completion to promote a market-based strategy to increasing residential energy efficiency. 
  
* **Are there local rules or regulations you need to consider?** For example, utility
  program regulators may require specific project details to be reported. You
  should coordinate with your local experts in these fields to help identify potential
  issues that will need to be addressed.
  
* **Which aspects of our overall goal should be prioritized?** Information technology (IT) solutions are often implemented in phases. Prioritizing your needs and implementation will help you save money and better manage resources. It is also important to engage stakeholders affected by the project (e.g., allies and contractors) to better manage expectations. This will also help reduce the pressure on the industry.
  
* **What is a realistic timing and rollout schedule?** The balance of the
  implementation document will help you identify the tasks you must complete to
  rollout HPXML. Give yourself plenty of time to complete these
  tasks and, if possible, plan your testing and launch schedule in the low
  season in order to reduce contractor burden.

By thinking strategically through the questions and identifying your project goals, you should be prepared to design the balance of your implementation plan.
