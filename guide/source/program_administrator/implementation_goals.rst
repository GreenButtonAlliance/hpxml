Step 1: Setting Implementation Goals
####################################

HPXML can drive a lot of value into a program. The key to delivering this
value is to determine the goals and scope of a HPXML project as early in
the process as possible. To date, many programs have used HPXML as a means to
open the modeling software market in their jurisdiction to multiple vendors. Others have used HPXML
as a way to increase their ability to share information with other market
actors, such as stakeholders in the real estate market. Regardless of your plans, it is important to
clearly define your objectives early, as these decisions will shape your implementation tactics.

To start, review each of the bullet points in the :doc:`opportunities_benefits` section.
Highlight which opportunities you would like to take advantage of in your
program implementation. For each opportunity, identify the following
information:

* **What is the baseline now and where do you want to be?** For example, if you
  want to "reduce the data collection burden for program participation," you
  will need to know how much it currently costs contractors in time or money to
  participate in the program, and work with them to identify a goal.
* **What are some of the current pain points?**  For example, are there specific
  elements of your current program implementation that drive customer or
  contractor dissatisfaction?  Likewise, are there any procedures in your
  process that create opportunities for error or mistakes? 
* **How will this help achieve overall program goals?** For example,
  what is your current number of projects per year and what would you like
  to increase it to? If you are focused on volume, your priorities might lie in
  HPXML efforts designed to increase volume, like integration with Home Energy
  Score or coordination with your local real estate market.
* **Are there local rules or regulations to consider?** For example, utility
  program regulators may require specific project details to be reported. You
  should coordinate with your local experts in these fields to help identify potential
  issues that will need to be addressed.
* **Which aspects of our overall goal should be prioritized?** You
  can achieve a lot with the data standards. However, as with many IT projects, it may make sense to implement in phases. Prioritizing the different components of your
  efforts and addressing the most important ones first will improve budget and
  resource management, as well as change management. Coordination with trade
  allies and contractors is key, and identifying how much change to institute at once can
  help reduce the pressure on the industry.
* **What is a realistic timing and rollout schedule?** The balance of the
  implementation document will help to identify the tasks you must complete to
  rollout HPXML. Give yourself plenty of time to complete these
  tasks and, if possible, plan your testing and launch schedule in the low
  season, in order to reduce contractor burden.

By thinking strategically through the questions outlined above and identifying
of which opportunities you want to take advantage, you should be prepared to design the
balance of your implementation plan.
