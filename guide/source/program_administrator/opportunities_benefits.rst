Opportunities and Benefits for HPXML Adoption
#############################################

HPXML was created to achieve some basic goals that are critical to a growing
industry:

#. Standardize terminology and facilitate the collection of higher quality
   data as a means to track and quantify the work being completed across the
   residential energy-efficiency industry.
#. Create interoperability between software systems to allow the transfer of
   home performance data across a diverse set of market actors.
#. Improve industry efficiency by reducing the costs of data collection and
   exchange between market actors.

Once adopted, HPXML has the potential to dramatically lower costs in a wide
range of areas as software vendors can use off-the-shelf solutions that
they have already developed, rather than building new systems for each client.
If this is done in coordination with other programs, utilities, and governments implementing HPXML, it can not only
lower operational costs, but provide access to a wide range of new
opportunities to help grow the local energy efficiency marketplace. While
these opportunities are expansive, it is important to remember that it is not necessary to take advantage of every opportunity that HPXML creates. In fact, it is important to identify priorities and to stage
adoption of them over time.

To help understand what opportunities are available and encourage getting the
most out of HPXML, several ideas have been identified at the trade ally, program
and national levels for consideration. These opportunities are as follows:

Trade Ally and Contractor Opportunities
***************************************

Participation in Home Performance or other energy-efficiency programs can help
contractors increase access to financing or incentives and align with marketing
and education efforts to promote their business. HPXML lets contracting
companies develop or procure systems that ease the burden of reporting to
programs, while improving the process for sales and customer engagement.  Some
of the opportunities for contractors include:

* **Reduce Data Collection Burden for Program Participation.** Many of the
  HPXML-compliant software tools offer contractors a more streamlined modeling
  or data collection experience. The more that programs can align around both
  the use of HPXML and the data set required between program or utility jurisdictions,
  the more that makers of these tools can focus their investments to provide new and
  innovative functionality to improve the contractor experience and reduce the
  cost to use the tools.  For example, contractors participating Arizona Public Service's Home Performance with ENERGY STAR\ |reg| program, experienced on average a 31% reduction in administrative time after the program's implementation of HPXML. 
* **Improved Sales Tools.** HPXML-compliant software tools offer a wide range
  of sales tools that can enable contractors to offer a more customizable
  experience aligned with their customer's needs.  This can help increase
  conversion rates and assist in the sales process.
* **Improve Business Analytics and Quality Management.** A standardization of performance data through HPXML enhances the opportunities to integrate this information into your business systems.  Using HPXML data, contractors are improving the way they can track performance drivers within projects to improve the delivery of internal quality management systems.  Additionally, enhanced tracking and trend analysis can help contracting companies better identify key drivers that impact profitability, customer satisfaction, and the performance of their products.    
* **Acquiring New Investment Resources.** As better data on energy efficiency
  improvements is transparent and easily shared within the market, the
  opportunity to recruit new financing resources increases. This can help grow
  the market while reducing the dependency on program funding to facilitate
  that growth.

Program, Utility and Local Governmental Jurisdictional Opportunities
********************************************************************

Faster and more flexible tools can lower program costs, increase trade ally satisfaction, improve data quality,
and drive innovation into programs. Working together with local contractors, an HPXML implementation will not only yield benefits to the program, but can assist in making the your program efforts more transparent to the larger market of residential home owners. The following are some of the
opportunities for HPXML that are being used by programs today:

* **Create an Open Modelling Software Market.**  HPXML allows
  participating contractors to choose which software tool they want to use for
  energy models. Implementing HPXML can streamline the process for
  contractors to submit consistent information to the program using a variety
  of tools. This improves contractor satisfaction and reduces labor per project.
* **Adoption of Mobile Data Collection Apps.** The ability to collect data on
  a mobile device can save time and reduce reporting errors. By coding these
  apps to HPXML, the data can be exported and stored in a standardized format
  that aligns with national reporting requirements and can be easily integrated
  with other software products.
* **Streamlined Quality Assurance.** As data becomes more standardized and
  consistent across multiple jurisdictions, software developers are creating
  more advanced QA systems to evaluate incoming data and guide quality
  assurance activities. The more automated desk reviews of projects for
  compliance with incentives and program rules become, the more
  quality can be maintained while reducing labor costs to manually review files. For one of the pilot programs, Arizona Public Service, time spent completing desk QA reviews has decreased by as much as 50% per project. In many implementations,
  programs are pursuing automated approvals can allow contractors to seek incentives or financing
  approvals while they are still on-site with the customer and further reduce the program administration costs per project.
* **Improved Program Analytics.** Improving both the quality and consistency
  of the data collected allows programs to complete comprehensive, ongoing
  analytics. HPXML data extracts can speed up or enhance measurement and
  evaluation efforts. Integrating HPXML data into marketing analytics can 
  help identify customers with a higher likelihood for savings or participation
  and provide new opportunities to use data to help grow the market.
* **Targeted or Trigger Based Marketing.**  HPXML can help programs capture
  details about a home's characteristics using online or in-field audit tools.
  This data can then be used to guide ongoing marketing investments by
  providing recommendations to customers that are most meaningful for their
  home and facilitate staging upgrade activities over time.
* **Export For Local Real Estate.** Working with local real estate and
  appraisal networks can identify data points and export strategies that
  work for those markets. This could include publishing completion certificates,
  providing the data to populate the Appraisal Institute's Green and Energy
  Efficient Addendum or directly export data to the local MLS. Doing this
  can help increase the value of EE in the real estate transaction and
  provide greater incentive and investment opportunity for home owners to fund
  energy efficiency upgrades. 

National Opportunities
**********************

Collecting standardized data sets across multiple programs and jurisdictions is a critical
step in helping guide national policy, financial investments, and research.
Adoption of HPXML commands higher quality data and transfer of that
data to a variety of actors in a cost-efficient manner:

* **Reporting to DOE or EPA Sponsored Programs.** Whether 
  participating in Home Performance with ENERGY STAR, Low Income
  Weatherization, or as an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner, HPXML can lower the cost and
  burden of data collection and reporting.
* **National Data Repositories.** Managed by federal agencies, trade ally
  associations, or other national organizations committed to the advancement of
  energy-efficiency investments, these repositories can organize data to track
  and quantify impacts of energy efficiency.  Efforts like the `building performance database website <http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/building-performance-database>`_ or the `Standard Energy Efficiency Data Platform <http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/standard-energy-efficiency-data-platform>`_ will not only make it easier for programs to collect and share data, but can allow the industry to compare results, improve transparency, and better identify performance drivers for program success. 
* **Coordination with Market Research.** National research efforts, whether
  lead by the Department of Energy, universities, industry organizations, or
  private companies, have struggled to get consistent and reliable data from
  multiple jurisdictions. By adopting HPXML, users can more easily participate in
  these efforts and gain valuable insights into a program's performance and
  the opportunities for emerging technologies in markets.

Beyond data collection and reporting, there are a number of national efforts
that the interoperability of HPXML can facilitate. While new efforts
are continually emerging, the following are some examples of current or
emerging opportunities:

* **DOE Home Energy Score.**  This allows homeowners to compare the energy
  performance of their homes to other homes nationwide. By collecting data in
  the field with an HPXML-compliant tool and transferring it to the DOE's
  application program interface (API) a Home Energy Score can be generated in real
  time. This adds the value of the Home Energy Score to programs, while
  minimizing integration costs. For more information or to get involved 
  visit the `Home Energy Score website <http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/home-energy-score>`_.
* **EPA ENERGY STAR® Home Advisor.** Create a profile of home energy
  efficiency features to receive a prioritized, customized list of energy-saving
  recommendations. Programs that complete on-line or in-person energy audits
  with HPXML-compliant tools will be able to allow customers to upload their
  recommendations, track their progress over time, and receive other
  energy-saving information from the EPA. For more information go to the
  `Home Energy Advisor website <https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/assessYourHome?fuseaction=home_energy_advisor.showgetinput>`_.
* **Multiple Listing Services.** Being able to accurately track energy
  efficiency improvements and make them known to potential homebuyers is a
  critical step in facilitating recognition of energy efficiency in the
  valuation of homes. The HPXML effort has been coordinated with Real Estate
  Transaction Standard (RETS), which is a national data standard from the
  `Real Estate Standards Organization <http://www.reso.org>`_. The multiple
  listing services, which represent the backbone of that real estate
  information industry, use RETS to maintain consistent data. For more
  information, see 
  `BPI-2101-S-2013 Standard Requirements for a Certificate of Completion for Residential Energy Upgrades <http://www.bpi.org/tools_downloads.aspx?selectedTypeID=1&selectedID=143>`_.

These are several of the recognized opportunities that have emerged to date. 
While others are being created all the time, it is important to pick those that
are most relevant to your jurisdiction and incorporate them into your
implementation plan as described in the next section of this document.
