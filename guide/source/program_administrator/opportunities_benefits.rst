Opportunities and Benefits for HPXML Adoption
#############################################

HPXML was created to achieve some basic goals that are critical to a growing
industry:

#. Standardize terminology and facilitate the collection of higher quality
   data as a means to track and quantify the work being completed across the
   residential energy-efficiency industry.
#. Create interoperability between software systems to allow the transfer of
   home performance data across a diverse set of market actors.
#. Improve industry efficiency by reducing the costs of data collection and
   exchange between market actors.

Once adopted, HPXML has the potential to dramatically lower costs in a wide
range of areas as software vendors can use off-the-shelf solutions that they
have already developed, rather than building new systems for each client. If
this is done in coordination with other programs, utilities, and governments
implementing HPXML, it can not only lower operational costs, but provide access
to a wide range of new opportunities to help grow the local energy efficiency
marketplace. 

To illustrate the potential opportunities created by HPXML, Figure 3 offers a
visualization of data flow for most program environments today, pre-HPXML.  This
is compared to a post-HPXML marketplace (Figure 4) in which home energy upgrades are
captured and transferred in a more standardize way and available to a larger
number of market actors.  This new data flow will facilitate emerging
opportunities in the valuation of energy efficiency and the availability of
financing for home energy upgrades.

While these opportunities are expansive, it is important to identify priorities
that are right for your program or jurisdiction and to stage adoption of these
initiatives over time.

To help better clarify some of the opportunities that are available and
encourage getting the most out of HPXML, several ideas have been identified at
the trade ally, program and national levels for your consideration. These
opportunities are as follows:

Trade Ally and Contractor Opportunities
***************************************

Participation in home performance or other energy-efficiency programs can help
contractors increase access to financing or incentives and align with marketing
and education efforts to promote their business. HPXML can let contracting
companies develop or procure systems that ease the burden of reporting to
programs, while improving the process for sales and customer engagement.  Some
of the opportunities for contractors include:

* **Reduce Data Collection Burden for Program Participation.** Many of the
  HPXML-compliant software tools offer contractors a more streamlined modeling
  or data collection experience. Contractors can choose tools that better align
  with their business models, improving primary data collection and
  significantly reducing the need to fill out rebate forms, retype data
  collected in the field and streamline job processing. For example, based on a
  survey of contractors before and after the implementation of their HPXML based
  program, contractors participating in Arizona Public Service's Home
  Performance with ENERGY STAR program,  reported an average 31% reduction in
  administrative time after switching to the new program system.
* **Improved Sales Tools.** HPXML-compliant software tools offer a wide range 
  of sales tools that can enable contractors to offer a more customizable
  experience aligned with their customer's needs. This can help increase
  conversion rates and assist in the sales process to acquire larger projects
  and more savings.
* **Improve Business Analytics and Quality Management.** Standardization of 
  performance data through HPXML enhances the opportunities to integrate this
  information into a contractor's business systems. Using HPXML data,
  contractors are evolving the way they can track performance drivers within
  projects to improve the delivery of internal quality management systems.
  Additionally, enhanced tracking and trend analysis can help contracting
  companies better identify key drivers that impact profitability, customer
  satisfaction, and the performance of their products.  These efforts can help
  grow the business and deliver more consistent and reliable performance.
* **Acquiring New Investment Resources.** As better data on energy efficiency 
  improvements is transparent and easily shared within the market, the
  opportunity to recruit new financing resources increases. This can help grow
  the market while reducing the dependency on program funding to facilitate that
  growth.

Program, Utility and Local Governmental Jurisdictional Opportunities
********************************************************************

Faster and more flexible tools can lower program costs, increase trade ally
satisfaction, improve data quality, and drive innovation into programs. Working
together with local contractors, an HPXML implementation will not only yield
benefits to the program, but can assist in making program efforts more
transparent to the larger market of homeowners. The following are
some of the opportunities for HPXML that are being used by programs today:

* **Create an Open Modelling Software Market.**  HPXML allows participating 
  contractors to choose which soft- ware tool they want to use for energy
  modeling. Implementing HPXML can streamline the process for contractors to
  submit consistent information to the program using a variety of tools. This
  can improve contractor satisfaction and reduce their labor per project by
  allowing them to choose the products that work best with their business model.
  Adding this flexibility in the program can be an important step toward
  accelerating the energy efficiency marketplace, by encouraging the growth of
  innovative tools and approaches.
* **Adoption of Mobile Data Collection Apps.** The ability to collect data on a
  mobile device can save time and reduce reporting errors. By coding these apps
  to HPXML, the data can be exported and stored in a standardized format that
  aligns with national reporting requirements and can be easily integrated with
  other software products.  For example, if you are administering a low-income
  weatherization program, field staff can us HPXML based mobile applications
  that sync to a central program database.  Once in a central database the tools
  can be used for reporting, quality assurance, and data analysis across
  jurisdictions.  This can reduce cost, but more importantly make it easier to
  track performance drivers against other HPXML jurisdictions.
* **Streamlined Quality Assurance (QA).** As data becomes more standardized and
  consistent across multiple jurisdictions, software developers are creating
  more advanced QA systems to evaluate incoming data and guide quality assurance
  activities. As desk reviews of projects for compliance with incentives and
  program rules become more automated, the more quality can be maintained while
  reducing labor costs to manually review files. For one of the pilot programs,
  Arizona Public Service, time spent completing desk QA reviews decreased by as
  much as 50% per project. In many implementations, programs are pursuing
  automated approvals that can allow contractors to seek incentives or financing
  approvals while they are still on-site with the customer and further reduce
  the program administration costs per project while improving
  assessment-to-upgrade conversion ratios.
* **Improved Program Analytics.** Improving both the quality and consistency of
  the data collected allows pro- grams to complete comprehensive, ongoing
  analytics. HPXML data extracts can speed up or enhance measurement and
  evaluation efforts, while making it easier to compare program performance
  characteristics with other programs. For example, if multiple programs use
  HPXML and one of the program is showing better results than the others, it
  will be easier with HPXML to identify trends in your program that are
  attributed to the performance differences.  This can then be compared to other
  programs who are tracking the same data, to better identify and share best
  practices.
* **Targeted or Trigger Based Marketing.**  HPXML can help programs capture 
  details about a home's characteristics using online or in-field audit tools.
  Integrating HPXML data into marketing analytics can help identify customers
  with a higher likelihood for savings or participation.  This data can then be
  used to guide ongoing marketing investments by providing recommendations to
  customers that are most meaningful for their home and facilitate staging
  upgrade activities over time.
* **Export for Local Real Estate.** Coordinating with local real estate and 
  appraisal networks can identify data points and export strategies that work
  for those markets. This could include publishing completion certificates,
  providing the data to populate the Appraisal Institute's Green and Energy
  Efficient Addendum or directly export data to the local Multiple Listing
  Service. Doing this can help increase the value of energy efficiency in the
  real estate transaction and provide greater incentive and investment
  opportunity for homeowners to fund energy efficiency upgrades.

Regional and National Opportunities
***********************************

Collecting standardized data sets across multiple programs and jurisdictions is
a critical step in helping guide national policy, financial investments, and
research. Adoption of HPXML commands higher quality data and transfer of that
data to a variety of actors in a cost-efficient manner:

* **Reporting to DOE or EPA Administered Programs.** Whether 
  participating in Home Performance with ENERGY STAR, Low Income
  Weatherization, or as an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner, HPXML can lower the cost and
  burden of data collection and reporting.
* **Regional or National Data Repositories.** Managed by federal agencies, trade ally
  associations, or other national organizations committed to the advancement of
  energy-efficiency investments, these repositories can organize data to track
  and quantify impacts of energy efficiency.  Efforts like the `Building
  Performance Database Website
  <http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/building-performance-database>`_ or the
  `Standard Energy Efficiency Data Platform
  <http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/standard-energy-efficiency-data-platform>`_
  will not only make it easier for programs to collect and share data, but can
  allow the industry to compare results, improve transparency, and better
  identify performance drivers for program success. 
* **Coordination with Market Research.** National research efforts, whether
  lead by the Department of Energy, universities, industry organizations, or
  private companies, have struggled to get consistent and reliable data from
  multiple jurisdictions. By adopting HPXML, users can more easily participate in
  these efforts and gain valuable insights into a program's performance and
  the opportunities for emerging technologies in markets.

Beyond data collection and reporting, there are a number of national efforts
that the interoperability of HPXML can facilitate. While new efforts
are continually emerging, the following are some examples of current or
emerging opportunities:

* **DOE Home Energy Score.**  This tool allows homeowners to compare the energy
  performance of their homes to other homes nationwide. By collecting data in
  the field with an HPXML-compliant tool and transferring it to DOE's
  application program interface (API) a Home Energy Score can be generated in real
  time, and minimizes integration costs. 
  
  The seamless integration of Home Energy Score through HPXML can make it easier
  for contractors and auditors to generate this simple 1 to 10 scale for your
  customers. This easy to understand score, combined with the standardized
  collection of data across Home Energy Score partners and jurisdictions can
  assist in raising the transparency of energy efficiency upgrades within your
  local market. As more homes are scored, this information should be shared with
  the real estate community and included in general consumer education campaigns
  to improve awareness, drive the value of energy efficiency, and increase
  project volume. 
  
  For more information visit `Home Energy Score`_.
* **EPA ENERGY STAR Home Advisor.** Create a profile of home energy efficiency
  features to receive a prioritized, customized list of energy-saving
  recommendations. Programs that complete on-line or in-person energy audits
  with HPXML-compliant tools could allow customers to upload their
  recommendations, track their progress over time, and receive other
  energy-saving information from the EPA. For more information go to the
  `Home Energy Advisor`_.
* **Multiple Listing Services.** Being able to accurately track energy 
  efficiency improvements and make them known to potential home buyers is a
  critical step in facilitating recognition of energy efficiency in the
  valuation of homes. The HPXML effort has been coordinated with Real Estate
  Transaction Standard (RETS), which is a national data standard from the
  `Real Estate Standards Organization`_. The multiple listing services, which
  represent the backbone of that real estate information industry, use RETS to
  maintain consistent data. For more information, see
  `BPI-2101-S-2013 Standard Requirements`_ for a Certificate of Completion for
  Residential Energy Upgrades.

These are several of the recognized opportunities that have emerged to date. 
While others are being created all the time, it is recommended to start with those that
are most relevant to your jurisdiction and incorporate them into your
implementation plan as described in the next section of this guide.
