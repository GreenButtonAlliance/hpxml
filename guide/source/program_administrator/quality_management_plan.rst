Step 7: Develop a Quality Management Plan
#########################################

Once your HPXML program is launched, you can take advantage of the standardized
data you have been collecting. This could be enhanced reporting, integration
with real estate databases, or any of the other activities identified in the
benefits section of this document. However, to ensure success with these
activities, it is important that the collected data accurately reflects
the characteristics of the homes participating in the program.  It is important
to develop a data quality management plan that allows for continuous evaluation
of the program to maximize accuracy. The following practices can be integrated
into a program plan, in addition to standard quality assurance
activities:

Complete a Regular Data Review
******************************

Consider scheduling a regular data review at least once a year, if not more
frequently. This is a basic audit of your data to make sure that you are
capturing all of the required data, a screen for data anomalies, and a way
to ensure your validation systems are working as expected. After these
meetings, consider communicating findings to all trade allies and software
vendors to facilitate continuous improvement.

QA Trend Analysis
*****************

Consider working with your program software vendor to add trend analysis
capability into your reporting systems. Even with an automated validation
system, it is possible to game the data and report only what will pass the
validation protocol. Your project-level QA strategy should provide some
verification activities to reduce the potential of this. However, it is often
not cost-efficient to schedule third-party verification of every home. Looking
for data trends can assist in identifying potential issues. For example, if a
large portion of jobs are reporting an installed condition that is almost
identical to manufacturer specifications, you could focus QA on these jobs to
further verify data accuracy.

Integrated Measurement and Evaluation
*************************************

With a rise in automated billing analysis software, automated metering, and
connected thermostats, there is an emerging ability to verify performance data
in a more dynamic fashion. This can help quickly identify potential issues with
data quality and help focus on continuous process improvements.

Regardless of the strategy you determine is right for your program, it is
important to complete a comprehensive evaluation of your data before you start
exporting data to market. Especially if you intend to use the data to guide
financial investments, continuous quality management will be a key to driving
success.
