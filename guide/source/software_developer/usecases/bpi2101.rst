BPI â€“ 2101 Certificate of Completion
####################################

This use case contains data that has the intent of informing real estate
transactions (See :ref:`bpi2101-use-case-defn`). It is likely the most
complicated use case and contains each of the following :ref:`building-node`
nodes.

* Pre-upgrade
* Proposed workscope
* Post-upgrade

Two :ref:`project-node` nodes are included as well that describe the proposed
project and the completed project. It can be thought of as a combination of the
:doc:`Audit and Upgrade <auditupgrade>` use cases. 

Finally, :ref:`consumption-node` and :ref:`utility-node` nodes are also included
to provide a utility billing history.

See the ``examples/bpi2101.xml`` document for more details on what data elements
are included.
