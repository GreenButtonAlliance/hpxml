The Need for Data Standardization

In todayâ€™s residential energy efficiency market the electronic exchange of information and data is often characterized by a
lack of common terms, definitions, and two-way feedback systems (Figure 1). This limits the ability of decision-makers to
access, aggregate, share and use data for the design and implementation of energy efficiency programs. This also makes it
difficult for market actors to understand the drivers of variation in performance (e.g., of measures, home improvements
contractors, energy efficiency programs, and homes), identify investment opportunities, and precisely quantify and project
savings from energy efficiency investments. 

To facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data on residential building and energy performance, the
Building Performance Institute (BPI), a nonprofit standards setting organization, developed and published the HPXML Data
Dictionary and the HPXML Transfer Standard. 

The HPXML Data Dictionary defines terms related to the physical attributes and performance of buildings and measures. It
provides a common vocabulary for the residential energy efficiency industry and the data standard also defines several standard
datasets that can be used to describe specific use cases, for example, information collected during the completion of a whole
-house program (need link to that section). 

The HPXML Transfer Standard provides requirements for an extensible mark-up language (XML) data transfer protocol that can be
used to transfer information related to energy efficiency upgrades between different software systems. The transfer standard is
the companion standard to the HPXML data dictionary. Each of the data elements defined in the data dictionary can be
transferred using HPXML.

Value of HPXML

It is the expectation of the U.S. Department of Energy that expanded use of
HPXML will achieve the following:

    * Reduce time and cost of collecting and transferring home and
      energy-related data;
    * Foster new and strengthen existing organizational relationships within
      the residential supply chain;
    * Increase the transparency of energy efficiency work tto facilitate deeper
      market penetration of energy efficiency products and services;
    * Enhance ability to quantify energy savings through standardized,
      data-rich EM&V methods;
    * Improve the quality assurance systems and practices needed to efficiently
      support, measure and verify energy performance.

Continued Growth

The HPXML Data Dictionary is designed to grow with our industry. If you have recommendations for adding new or changing
existing data elements or enumerations, create a new issue on the Github repository or send us an email with the following
information.

    * Name: Create a name for the data element or enumeration you feel best describes the term.
    * Definition: Write a comprehensive definition of the data element and include references if necessary.
    * Data Type: Include your recommended data type and maximum field length.
    * Enumerations: If your recommended field is a pick-list, please include enumerations. Enumerations may also need a definition.
    * Justification: Please provide a reason the data element is important to your energy efficiency program or market.
    * Duplication: Review the dictionary thoroughly to ensure you are not duplicating an already existing data element or enumeration. Concepts can be expressed in a number of ways and rather than adding additional data elements or enumerations, we can use this recommendation to better define existing elements.

How to Use the Implementation Guide

Significant effort has gone into the development of HPXML and this
Implementation Guide, but the work is not complete.  HPXML is constantly being
improved and this Implementation Guide will benefit from the lessons learned by
different organizations integrating HPXML into their operations.  If you have
questions about HPXML or believe you can contribute to the overall success of
its deployment, please email us at homeperformance@energystar.gov.  HPXML was
developed and deployed through a collaborative process, and we intend to
continue in that spirit to expand its execution and improvement.
